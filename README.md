# Hi everyone! 👋

I'm **Andrea Verrone**, an Italian student from Milan who really likes coding and developing software 👨‍💻, both front-end and back-end. 
I’ve started coding when I was in high school and never stopped since. </br>
I have a Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering 🦿 and I’m currently studying for a Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering 💻, both taken at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).

## Some of my works 🛠

I’ve worked on several projects during my career, some as the result of a University course and others on my own.
- **[Eriantys](https://github.com/AndreaVerrone/ing-sw-2022-miani-porta-verrone):** a digital version developed in Java of the homonymous board game created by Cranio Creations. 
- **[AMaBeL](https://xd.adobe.com/view/05170fde-40d6-4397-405e-6a045c894ac3-7326/?fullscreen):** a mobile application used to control and mitigate anxiety attacks designed during my thesis work for the Bachelor’s Degree. Currently I’m working on developing this application. 
- **[Milan Arts Experience](https://github.com/francescoaristei/summer-festival):** a [website](https://summer-festival.herokuapp.com/) created as the final project of a course at Politecnico di Milano, in which I worked on the design of the website using Figma.
- **[Organized ToDo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anverapps.organized_todo):** a Flutter app available for both [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anverapps.organized_todo) and [browser](https://organized-todo.web.app/) that lets you create fine-grained to-do lists
